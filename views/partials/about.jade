			p I'm Alyssa: a Christian, wife, and (cue the fireworks!) dog trainer, in that order.
			p But before I fill you in on my journey to this point in my life, I’d like to spend a few lines explaining how I can help you.
			p Like you, I am a dog lover. But for as much love as we have for our furry canine companions, sometimes living together can be challenging. Whether it’s barking at other dogs, potty training issues, or pulling on leash, unwanted behaviors can make our lives (and our dogs’ lives) difficult. In fact, us humans often need some coaching on how to effectively teach our critters what we want from them. And that’s where I come in.
			p As a certified Trainer and Behavior Consultant, I am here to help you and your dog live a more peaceful and stress-free life together. My mission is to provide the highest quality, force-free, scientific-based dog training and care for each of my clients and their furry family members. Dancing tails are a natural result of my work, because I attend to the physical, emotional, and environmental wellbeing of the dogs in my care. I am currently operating out of Berkeley, California and serve dog owners in the East Bay Area.

			p Animals have always been a passion of mine. As a child, my parents simply couldn’t keep me away from animals. Growing up I had birds, fish, a snake, pet rats, hermit crabs, rabbits, hamsters, spiders...and of course, dogs! I loved dogs so much that I eagerly groomed, fed, and walked my older sibling's pooches when hanging out with them. Some of my favorite memories are with Zeus the Husky, Mara the Malamute, Tillie the Chihuahua, Zoe the Boxer, and Lola the Rottweiler. I couldn't get enough of these pups! I think it’s safe to say that my passion for animals has continued to this day...

			p The summer before I left home for college I worked as a veterinary technician, which was a great experience, but I left knowing that veterinary work was not right for me. Then, I headed off to Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo in pursuit of an Animal Science degree. As a pre-veterinary program, I studied nutrition, anatomy, physiology, and learned many hands-on techniques for interacting with livestock to caring for our beloved dogs. In order to get my “dog fix,” I volunteered as an Advanced Canine Handler at Woods Humane in San Luis Obispo, California, where I taught homeless dogs basic obedience and spent quality time with them. After my second year at Cal Poly I even had the opportunity to spend a summer in Bermuda training dolphins for Dolphin Quest, which (as you can imagine) was a pretty incredible experience! But after I graduated from Cal Poly, I once again found myself knowing more about what I did not want to do, as opposed to what I did want to do: Working with livestock and training dolphins just didn’t fit the bill.

			p It was during my time at Cal Poly that I came to know Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior, and met my now-husband, Rob. We got married soon after his graduation and moved up to Arcata, California to pursue master’s degrees at Humboldt State University. My degree program was called Environment and Community, and it was an interdisciplinary program focused on the intersection between people, economics, and the environment. While I was fascinated by these interactions, what I learned most from my time in graduate school was that I enjoyed coaching students and leading workshops during my job as an Academic Advisor. Once I graduated, I knew I wanted to educate adults and incorporate animals into my future career. Then, I found the Dog Training Internship Academy (DTIA) based in San Francisco, which was originally started by expert dog trainer Janis Bradley of the San Francisco SPCA Academy for Dog Trainers. DTIA was conceived after the San Francisco SPCA Academy closed in 2010.
			p I discovered that dog training was the marriage of two things I loved: coaching people and interacting with dogs. Through DTIA’s rigorous 6-month program, I received a world-class education in dog training and behavior counseling. Specifically, I received a thorough foundation in science-based dog training, hands-on experience with real-life behavior modification cases, and personal coaching in both training techniques and client counseling. I also logged hundreds of hours training dogs.
			p And that brings us up to the present, where I am now the owner of Dancing Tails Dog Training. I thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, and I hope to meet you soon. If you have questions or are interested in a training consultation, please
